			    <h2>The Milky way Galaxy</h2>
				<p> Our Sun(a star)and all the planets around it are part of a galaxy known as the Milky Way Galaxy.
				A Galaxy is a large group of stars, gas, and dust bound together by gravity.They come in a variety of shapes and sizes.
				The Milky Way is a large bound of spiral galaxy.All the star we see in the night sky are in our Milky Way Galaxy.
				Our Galaxy is called a Milky Way Galaxy because it appers as a milky band of light in the sky when you see it in a really dark area</p>
				<p>Although Earth lies well within the Milky Way Galaxy(sometimes simply called a Galaxy),astronomers do not have as complete an understanding of its nature as they do of some external star systems.
				a thick layer of interstellar dust obsures much of the Galaxy from scrutinty by optical telescopes,
				and astronomers can determine its large-scale structure only with the aid ratio and infrared telescopes,which can detect the forms of radiation that penetrate the obscuring matter.

				<b>"Deadvlei" by Stefan Liebermann shows the Milky Way stretching out over Namib-Naukluft National Park in Namibia.</b><br>
				<p>
				"The trees in Deadvlei have been dead for over 500 years," Liebermann wrote. "Located in Namib-Naukluft Park in Namibia, these saplings grew after local rivers flooded because of severe rainfalls, but died after the sand dunes shifted to section off the river. High above and far in the distance, the band of our Milky Way galaxy forms an arch over a large stalk in this night panorama image."
